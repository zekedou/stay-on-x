# Remove the Red Badge from the System Settings Dock Icon

Get rid of the persistent notification badge on the System Settings icon in your Dock.

If you're tired of the persistent red notification badge on the **System Settings** icon in your Dock (indicating a software update is available), this guide walks you through removing it.

> **Note:** The "Software Update Available (1)" entry will still appear inside the System Settings sidebar — this only removes the red badge from the Dock icon.

> **Heads up:** You will likely need to repeat these steps after each macOS update (e.g. upgrading from 15.7.2 to 15.7.3).

## Prerequisites

- Download [**Prefs Editor**](https://apps.tempel.org/PrefsEditor/) from Thomas Tempelmann (developer of [Find Any File](https://apps.tempel.org/FindAnyFile/))

## Steps

### 1. Open Prefs Editor

Launch the **Prefs Editor** app you just downloaded.

### 2. Find the Dock preferences

In the filter/search box, type:

```
dock
```

### 3. Open your Dock preferences file

Double-click **`com.apple.dock`**, then double-click the option that reads:

```
/Users/<your-username>/Library/Preferences
```

### 4. Locate the System Settings entry

In the filter/search box, type:

```
system
```

Scroll through the results until you find a **Value** that contains:

```
file:///System/Applications/System%20Settings.app/
```

### 5. Note the parent Item number

Look at the **Key** column for that entry and note its parent **Item** number (e.g. `Item 24`).

### 6. Disable the badge

Go back to the filter/search box and type:

```
dock
```

Find the Item number you noted in the previous step. Under that item, locate the badge toggle set to **YES** and **uncheck** it (this sets it to **NO**).

### 7. Save your changes

Press **Cmd + S** to save the file.

### 8. Close Prefs Editor

Close the window and quit **Prefs Editor**.

### 9. Restart the Dock

Open **Terminal** and run:

```bash
killall Dock
```

### 10. Verify

The red badge should now be gone. You can optionally reboot to confirm the change persists.

## Reverting

To bring the badge back, repeat the steps above but re-check the value back to **YES**, save, and run `killall Dock` again.
